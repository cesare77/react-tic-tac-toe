# react-tic-tac-toe

React tic-tac-toe game from react-dev [official learning page](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)

## Git commands overview

- `git remote add origin <repository url>` to sync project to remote
- `git push --force -u -origin master` to push to remote
- `git add .` to add changes to commit
- `git commit -m "message"` to do commit with message
- `git push -u origin master` to push changes to origin
- `git log --oneline` to view commit logs
- `git status` to view current git status

## Extra improvements

1. For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.
2. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
3. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
4. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).
5. Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.
